# QMatch: The Quantum version of your favorite dating app
(Anyone who is available please sketch out this README!)

## Abstract
Dating Matching App using quantum principles (VQE) for matching/unmatching Quantum Computing Engineers/Scientists with the scientists of their dreams. Each of the questions for matching are directly linked to a random matrix for which you have to obtain a good enough approximation to obtain a profile with the attributes you want.

## Introduction
Quantum Computing (QC) is the paradigm that uses Quantum properties applied to computations in order to accelerate them. Among the various algorithms and applications of QC, Varational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum/classical hybrid algorithm for estimating the lower and upper bounds from a certain matrix $H$ (the Hamiltonian of the system).

In this project, we propose a Dating Matching App where each of the questions asked to the user are assigned a random matrix $H$ for which you have to create an ansatz to approximate its ground state.


## Motivation/goals
Our motivation was to give a "quantum spin" to an already popular dating app. Our focus was on using the VQE as a metaphorical approach to select "yes" or "no" to certain personality criteria while implementing an interactive platform to learn about constructing effective ansatzes. If your approximation is good enough to the ground state of the matrix of that attribute, then you have good "chemistry" with it. Thus, after several approximations (selection criteria), users will have matched with a quantum engineer they are compatible with. Here, famous physicists serve as placeholders for what could be real user profiles of those in the quantum community. 

Our goal is to introduce users to the VQE algorithm by letting them propose simple ansatzs and select a parameter/angle which approximates the ground state of the system. With practice, users should be able to improve their ability to choose ansatz with higher fidelity. 

## Description

## Proposals for future work

 * Implement the game with better graphics.
 * Use real profiles by multiple users that play the game (databases).
 * Introduce a swiping mechanic.
