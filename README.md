# QMatch: The Quantum version of your favorite dating app
(Anyone who is available please sketch out this README!)

## Abstract
QMatch is a matchingmaking app that relys on quantum principles (VQE) for matching Quantum Computing Engineers/Scientists with the scientists of their dreams. The questions used for assessing compatibility are directly linked to a random matrix for which users must obtain an accurate enough approximation to match with a profile with the desired attributes. 

## Introduction
With more than 1500 dating apps having been created to date, it is clear that online matchmaking is a huge market with an expansive and diverse user base. For anyone who has used one of these applications, it is clear that there is some ingredient missing in their matchmaking algorithms. That missing ingredient is *Quantum Mechanics*. With QMatch, we utilize the power of quantum computing and quantum/classical algorithms to help you find your true *entangled pair*.

Quantum Computing (QC) is the paradigm that uses Quantum properties applied to computations in order to accelerate them. Among the various algorithms and applications of QC, Varational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum/classical hybrid algorithm for estimating the lower and upper bounds from a certain matrix $H$ (the Hamiltonian of the system).


## Basic Principles
In this project, we propose a matchmaking application where each of the questions asked to the user are assigned a random matrix $H$ for which you have to create an ansatz to approximate its ground state. Add more info on VQE...

## Motivation/goals
Our motivation was to give a "quantum spin" to an already popular dating app. Our focus was on using the VQE as a metaphorical approach to select "yes" or "no" to certain personality criteria while implementing an interactive platform to learn about constructing effective ansatzes. If your approximation is good enough to the ground state of the matrix of that attribute, then you have good "chemistry" with it. Thus, after several approximations (selection criteria), users will have matched with a quantum engineer they are compatible with. Here, famous physicists serve as placeholders for what could be real user profiles of those in the quantum community. 

Our goal is to introduce users to the VQE algorithm by letting them propose simple ansatzs by selecting parameters/angle which approximates the ground state of the system. With practice, users should be able to improve their ability to choose ansatz with higher fidelity. 

## Proposals for future work

 * Implement the game with better graphics.
 * Use real profiles by multiple users that play the game (databases).
 * Introduce a swiping mechanic.
