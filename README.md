# QTinder: The Quantum version of your favorite dates app
(Anyone who is available please sketch out this README!)

## Abstract
Dating Matching App using quantum principles (VQE) for matching/unmatching Quantum Computing Engineers/Scientists with the scientists of their dreams. Each of the questions for matching are directly linked to a random matrix for which you have to obtain a good enough approximation to obtain a profile with the attributes you want.

## Introduction
Quantum Computing (QC) is the paradigm that uses Quantum properties applied to computations in order to accelerate them. Among the various algorithms and applications of QC, Varational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum/classical hybrid algorithm for estimating the lower and upper bounds from a certain matrix $H$ (the Hamiltonian of the system).

In this project, we propose a Dating Matching App where each of the questions asked to the user are assigned a random matrix $H$ for which you have to create an ansatz to approximate its ground state.


## Motivation/goals
Our motivation was to give a "quantum spin" to an already popular dating app. Our focus was on using the VQE as a metaphorical way for matching with a specific profile. If your approximation is good enough to the ground state of the matrix of that attribute, then you have good "chemistry" with it. Thus, you will have a partner with that characteristic.

Our goal is to introduce the users to the VQE algorithm by letting them propose simple ansatzs and select a parameter/angle which approximates the ground state of the system. If the user knows about it, he/she could propose ansatzs with higher fidelity.

## Description

## Proposals for future work

 * Implement the game with better graphics.
 * Use real profiles by multiple users that play the game (data bases).
 * Introduce a swiping mechanic.
